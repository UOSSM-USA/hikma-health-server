## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Schema

The patient registration system uses the following key tables:
- `patients`: Main patient records
- `patient_additional_attributes`: Extended patient data
- `clinics`: Clinic information
- `patient_registration_forms`: Form configurations

### Form Rendering

The registration form uses:
- React Hook Form for form management
- SelectInput component for dropdowns
- DatePickerInput for date selection
- Proper validation and error handling

### Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- SQL syntax errors
- UUID serialization issues
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data formats
- Database connection issues

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Event Form Builder UI Fixes
- **Issue**: Duplicate field names error when adding multiple Medicine or Diagnosis fields
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded field names ("Medication", "ICD 11 Diagnosis") in ComponentRegistry
- **Solution**: Changed hardcoded names to empty strings (`name: ""`) for user customization
- **Files Modified**: `src/routes/app/event-forms.edit.$.tsx`
- **Result**: Users can now add multiple fields of the same type without conflicts

### Sample Data Script Improvements
- **Issue**: Scripts creating duplicate data on multiple runs
- **Solution**: Implemented duplicate prevention logic and `--cleanup` flag
- **Features Added**:
  - Check for existing records before creation
  - Skip creation if data already exists
  - `--cleanup` flag to soft delete and recreate data
  - Comprehensive logging and status messages
- **Scripts Updated**: All sample data creation scripts
- **Result**: Clean, non-duplicate data management

### Database Schema Fixes
- **Issue**: UUID serialization errors with Option types
- **Solution**: Extract raw values from Option types before database insertion
- **Issue**: Missing foreign key constraints (visit_id for appointments)
- **Solution**: Create visit records before creating appointments
- **Issue**: Column name mismatches (first_name vs name, scheduled_date vs timestamp)
- **Solution**: Corrected column names to match database schema
- **Result**: All database operations working correctly

### Form Field Type Corrections
- **Issue**: primary_clinic_id field not appearing as dropdown
- **Solution**: Changed fieldType from "text" to "select" in registration form
- **Issue**: Empty form fields causing SQL syntax errors
- **Solution**: Added conditional checks for empty arrays before database insertion
- **Result**: All form fields rendering and saving correctly
