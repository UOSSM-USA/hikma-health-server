 * A full backfill is thousands of sequential pages from one device, and the

 * NAT would starve not just its own restore but every other command for
 * everyone on that connection. `checkBackfillLimit` keys the ceiling on the
 * caller instead, under a much higher per-IP backstop that bounds an
 * unauthenticated caller rotating bearer tokens to mint fresh buckets.
 *
 * In-memory and per-process, like every limiter here: on a multi-instance
 * deploy the effective ceiling is these numbers times the instance count.
